        There was always something slightly dangerous about Joan. So, when she
        turns up at private investigator Henry Kimball’s office asking him to
        investigate her husband, he can’t help feeling ill at ease. Just the
        sight of her stirs up a chilling memory: he knew Joan in his previous
        life as a high school English teacher, when he was at the center of a
        tragedy.
        <br /><br />
        Now Joan needs his help in proving that her husband is cheating. But
        what should be a simple case of infidelity becomes much more complicated
        when Kimball finds two bodies in an uninhabited suburban home with a
        “for sale” sign out front. Suddenly it feels like the past is repeating
        itself, and Henry must go back to one of the worst days of his life to
        uncover the truth.
        <br /><br />
        Is it possible that Joan knows something about that day, something she’s
        hidden all these years? Could there still be a killer out there, someone
        who believes they have gotten away with murder? Henry is determined to
        find out, but as he steps closer to the truth, a murderer is getting
        closer to him, and in this hair-raising game of cat and mouse only one
        of them will survive.
