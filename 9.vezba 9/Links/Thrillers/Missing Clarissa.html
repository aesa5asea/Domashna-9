        In August of 1999, dazzlingly popular cheerleader Clarissa Campbell
        disappears from a party in the woods outside the rural town of Oreville,
        Washington and is never seen again. The police question her friends,
        teachers, and the adults who knew her—who all have something to hide.
        And thanks to Clarissa’s beauty, the mystery captures the attention of
        the nation. But with no leads and no body, the case soon grows cold.
        Despite the efforts of internet sleuths and true-crime aficionados,
        Clarissa is never found—dead or alive.
        <br /><br />
        Over twenty years later, Oreville high-school juniors and best friends
        Blair and Cameron start a true crime podcast, determined to unravel the
        story of what—or who—happened to this rural urban legend. In the process
        they uncover a nest of dirty small-town secrets, the sordid truth of
        Clarissa’s relationship with her charismatic boyfriend, and a high
        school art teacher turned small-town figurehead who had a very good
        reason for wanting Clarissa dead. Such a good reason, in fact, that they
        might have to make him the highlight of their next episode…
        <br /><br />
        But does an ugly history with a missing girl make him guilty of murder?
        Or are two teenage girls about to destroy the life of an innocent
        man—and help the true killer walk free?
