        Edward Ashton is the author of the novels Mickey7, Three Days in April
        and The End of Ordinary. His short fiction has appeared in venues
        ranging from the newsletter of an Italian sausage company to Escape Pod,
        Analog, and Fireside Fiction. He lives in upstate New York in a cabin in
        the woods (not that Cabin in the Woods) with his wife, a variable number
        of daughters, and an adorably mopey dog named Max, where he
        writes—mostly fiction, occasionally fact—under the watchful eyes of a
        giant woodpecker and a rotating cast of barred owls. In his free time,
        he enjoys cancer research, teaching quantum physics to sullen graduate
        students, and whittling. You can find him online at edwardashton.com or
        on Twitter @edashtonwriting.
