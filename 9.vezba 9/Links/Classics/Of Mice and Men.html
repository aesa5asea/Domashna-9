        They are an unlikely pair: George is "small and quick and dark of face";
        Lennie, a man of tremendous size, has the mind of a young child. Yet
        they have formed a "family," clinging together in the face of loneliness
        and alienation. Laborers in California's dusty vegetable fields, they
        hustle work when they can, living a hand-to-mouth existence. But George
        and Lennie have a plan: to own an acre of land and a shack they can call
        their own.
        <br /><br />
        While the powerlessness of the laboring class is a recurring theme in
        Steinbeck's work of the late 1930s, he narrowed his focus when composing
        'Of Mice and Men' (1937), creating an intimate portrait of two men
        facing a world marked by petty tyranny, misunderstanding, jealousy, and
        callousness. But though the scope is narrow, the theme is universal: a
        friendship and a shared dream that makes an individual's existence
        meaningful.
        <br /><br />
        A unique perspective on life's hardships, this story has achieved the
        status of timeless classic due to its remarkable success as a novel, a
        Broadway play, and three acclaimed films.
