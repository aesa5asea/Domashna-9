      <p style="margin-left: 500px; margin-right: 700px">
        Antoine de Saint-Exupéry was born in Lyons on June 29, 1900. He flew for
        the first time at the age of twelve, at the Ambérieu airfield, and it
        was then that he became determined to be a pilot. He kept that ambition
        even after moving to a school in Switzerland and while spending summer
        vacations at the family's château at Saint-Maurice-de-Rémens, in eastern
        France. (The house at Saint-Maurice appears again and again in
        Saint-Exupéry's writing.) Later, in Paris, he failed the entrance exams
        for the French naval academy and, instead, enrolled at the prestigious
        art school l'Ecole des Beaux-Arts. In 1921 Saint-Exupéry began serving
        in the military, and was stationed in Strasbourg. There he learned to be
        a pilot, and his career path was forever settled.
